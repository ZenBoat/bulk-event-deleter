# BED: Bulk event deleter for Google Calendar. Log in, search for events you don't like, and delete them all. 

## Use cases:
- Accidentally added many similar events to the wrong calendar
- Added a bunch of events, only a few of which you care about (e.g. university lectures :poop:)

## TODOs
- Add UI error handling for login fails/ internet connectivity issues
- Fix typescript warnings
- Refactor AxiosInstance into module
